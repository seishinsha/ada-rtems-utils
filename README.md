# ada-rtems-utils

This directory contains an Ada95 implementation of an IDE driver
and FAT16 filesystem for RTEMS. I wrote this as a student in
Universidad de Zaragoza around 1999 (last century, wow!)

Hopefully this will be useful to someone providing IDE or FAT16
support for RTEMS.

It was incorporated to RTEMS contributions repository in Feb. 2002:
